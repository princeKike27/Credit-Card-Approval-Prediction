# Credit Card Approval Prediction

For this project I created a Machine Learning Model that predicts if an applicant is a *good* or *bad* client for having a Credit Card Approved. Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry since it uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is then able to decide, whether or not to issue a credit card to the applicant.
