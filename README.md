# Credit Card Approval Prediction

For this project I created a Machine Learning Model that predicts if an applicant is a good or bad client. Since the definition of good or bad is not given, a technique like Vintage Analysis needs to be used to construct the label

- Vintage Analysis is a widely used method for managing credit risk that illustrates the behavior after an account was opened. Based on the origination period, it calculates charge-off ratio of a loan portfolio.


Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is then able to decide, whether or not to issue a credit card to the applicant
